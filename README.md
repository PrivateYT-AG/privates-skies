# Private's Skies
### Note: Private's Skies requires [Polytone](https://modrinth.com/mod/polytone) to work.
A resource pack that overhauls sky and fog colors in many biomes, in a semi-realistic and fantasy style, with special fog effects for swamps and pale gardens.

<summary>1.21.6 Support?</summary>
This pack works in 1.21.6 and above, but since the latest Polytone release for 1.21.6 does not support fog effects (due to rendering changes), there will be no special fog in swamps and pale gardens for now. For this reason, it's best to use this pack in Minecraft 1.21.5 and below.
