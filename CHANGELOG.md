# Changelog

## [2.0-beta1] - 2026-01-10
Fog effects are back for Minecraft 1.21.11, the biomes affected are:
- Pale gardens
- Swamps and mangrove swamps
- Cave biomes (deep dark, dripstone caves, lush caves)

These fog effects are *very* subtle if you don't use a high render distance. At 32 chunks, it provides a slight difference (pale garden is way more noticeable). The fog also gets heavier when it's raining. Alformentioned changes are not present in versions below 1.21.11.

This version adds new cloud colors for:

- cherry groves
- deep dark
- deserts

This change is only available for Minecraft 1.21.11.
